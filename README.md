# Metis Introduction to Data Science Course Project

*An Introduction To The Tools Of Data Science*

This project constists of exploratory analysis of contraceptive use in Indonesia in the year 1987 using python and pandas. I also attempt to build a classifier using Scikit Learn to predict whether a woman uses contraception, and if so what kind. The key findings are:

   - I need more data (duh)
   - No seriously... more data
   - Main factors appear to be religion (negative correlation to bc usage) and education (positive correlation).
   - Age/generation also seem to contribute to birth control usage, which may indicate that usage is in a phase of growth.
